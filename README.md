# Greenhouse_emissions

### Overview
This SQL project aims to analyse the interrelationship between greenhouse gas emissions, demographic changes, and economic growth across various countries. By integrating data from two key datasets—one detailing greenhouse gas emissions and another cataloging population and GDP figures—I seek to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that can inform policy decisions, environmental impact assessments, and sustainability initiatives globally. The dataset for this analysis is from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-greenhouse-gas-emissions)

### Data Description

#### 1. Greenhouse Gas Emissions Dataset
- **Contents**: Contains detailed records of greenhouse gas emissions by country, segmented by source including coal, oil, gas, and cement production. It also includes total CO2 emissions and methane emissions figures.


#### 2. Population and GDP Dataset
- **Contents**: Provides annual population figures and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for each country. It also measures primary energy consumption, offering insights into how energy usage correlates with population size and economic output.


#### 3. Joined Dataset
- **Integration**: The two datasets are merged on 'country' and 'year' to create a unified view that facilitates multi-dimensional analysis.
- **Analysis Goals**: With the joined dataset, the project explores how economic and population growth relate to increases in greenhouse gas emissions, investigates per capita emissions, assesses energy efficiency, and examines the economic impacts of environmental policies.



### Significance
The project's findings are expected to contribute valuable knowledge to global efforts aimed at reducing emissions and promoting sustainability. By understanding the detailed interplay between economy, demographics, and emissions, countries can tailor their environmental and economic policies to better suit their unique circumstances and global commitments to climate change mitigation.
